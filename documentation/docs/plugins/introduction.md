# Plugins Introduction

Modular plugins give the capacity to any partner to add new features and third-party libraries inside our applications. Plugins interact and extend our products in every possible way.

Plugins must be hosted on your own infrastructure. This gives you full control over the technologies you use and when you want to update your plugin(s).

## Use Cases

Here's some ideas on how to extend our products, imagination is our only limitation here.

### E-UC Apps

- **SMS**: With plugins, you can add in an SMS provider to our app. Add a new tab from the plugin manifest and connect it to your favorite SMS provider. Starting from there, you can add new sophisticated functionalities of your choice.
- **CRM**: Match all incoming calls to any CRM, even any internal CRM with an API Available.
- **Internal Tools**: Add a wide range of tools to help your organization. From a simple list of documents to an integrated calculation tool that helps your sales team during a call.

### E-UC Portal

- **Realtime dashboard**: Add a new tab inside your stack's dashboard to show realtime metrics. This dashboard could be built to show specific KPIs or any other data from an external API.
- **Extend any form**: Plugins allow you to add any tabs in any form. You could map information related to any users, devices, or conferences from an external or internal system.
- **Support Center Dashboard**: Add your own support center page to help your customers troubleshoot problems or contact the support team.
